    <abstract>
      <t>RFC 7125 revised the tcpControlBits IP Flow Information Export
      (IPFIX) Information Element that was originally defined in RFC 5102 to
      reflect changes to the TCP Flags header field since RFC 793. However,
      that update is still problematic for interoperability because some
      values were deprecated since then.</t>

      <t>This document updates RFC 7125 by removing stale information from the
      IPFIX registry and avoiding conflicts with the authoritative TCP
      registry.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>TCP defines a set of control bits (also known as "flags") for
      managing connections. The "Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Header
      Flags" registry was initially set by <xref target="RFC3168"></xref>, but
      it was populated with only TCP control bits that were defined in <xref
      target="RFC3168"></xref>. <xref target="RFC9293"></xref> fixed that by
      moving that registry to be listed as a subregistry under the
      "Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Parameters" registry, adding bits
      that had previously been specified in <xref target="RFC0793"></xref>,
      and removing the NS (Nonce Sum) bit as per <xref
      target="RFC8311"></xref>. Also, <xref target="RFC9293"></xref>
      introduces "Bit Offset" to ease referencing each header flag's offset
      within the 16-bit aligned view of the TCP header (Section 3.1 of <xref
      target="RFC9293"></xref>). <xref target="TCP-FLAGS"></xref> is thus
      settled as the authoritative reference for the assigned TCP control
      bits.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC7125"></xref> revised the tcpControlBits IP Flow
      Information Export (IPFIX) Information Element that was originally
      defined in <xref target="RFC5102"></xref> to reflect changes to the TCP
      Flags header field since <xref target="RFC0793"></xref>. However, that
      update is still problematic for interoperability because a value was
      deprecated since then (Section 7 of <xref target="RFC8311"></xref>) and,
      therefore, <xref target="RFC7125"></xref> risks to deviate from the
      authoritative registry <xref target="TCP-FLAGS"></xref>. </t>

      <t>This document fixes that problem by removing stale information from
      the IPFIX registry and avoiding future conflicts with the authoritative
      TCP registry. Also, because the setting of control bits may be misused
      in some flows (e.g., DDoS attacks), an exporter has to report all
      observed control bits even if no meaning is currently associated with a
      given flag. This document uses a stronger requirement language compared
      to <xref target="RFC7125"></xref>. See <xref target="update"></xref> for
      more details.</t>
