   An Update to the tcpControlBits IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)
                          Information Element
              draft-boucadair-opsawg-rfc7125-update-latest

Abstract

   RFC 7125 revised the tcpControlBits IP Flow Information Export
   (IPFIX) Information Element that was originally defined in RFC 5102
   to reflect changes to the TCP Flags header field since RFC 793.
   However, that update is still problematic for interoperability
   because some values were deprecated since then.

   This document updates RFC 7125 by removing stale information from the
   IPFIX registry and avoiding conflicts with the authoritative TCP
   registry.

1.  Introduction

   TCP defines a set of control bits (also known as "flags") for
   managing connections.  The "Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
   Header Flags" registry was initially set by [RFC3168], but it was
   populated with only TCP control bits that were defined in [RFC3168].
   [RFC9293] fixed that by moving that registry to be listed as a
   subregistry under the "Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
   Parameters" registry, adding bits that had previously been specified
   in [RFC0793], and removing the NS (Nonce Sum) bit as per [RFC8311].
   Also, [RFC9293] introduces "Bit Offset" to ease referencing each
   header flag's offset within the 16-bit aligned view of the TCP header
   (Section 3.1 of [RFC9293]).  [TCP-FLAGS] is thus settled as the
   authoritative reference for the assigned TCP control bits.

   [RFC7125] revised the tcpControlBits IP Flow Information Export
   (IPFIX) Information Element that was originally defined in [RFC5102]
   to reflect changes to the TCP Flags header field since [RFC0793].
   However, that update is still problematic for interoperability
   because a value was deprecated since then (Section 7 of [RFC8311])
   and, therefore, [RFC7125] risks to deviate from the authoritative
   registry [TCP-FLAGS].

   This document fixes that problem by removing stale information from
   the IPFIX registry and avoiding future conflicts with the
   authoritative TCP registry.  Also, because the setting of control
   bits may be misused in some flows (e.g., DDoS attacks), an exporter
   has to report all observed control bits even if no meaning is

   currently associated with a given flag.  This document uses a
   stronger requirement language compared to [RFC7125].  See Section 3
   for more details.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the terms defined in Section 2 of [RFC7011].

3.  An Update to tcpControlBits IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)
    Information Element

   This document updates Section 3 of [RFC7125] as follows:

   OLD:
      The values of each bit are shown below, per the definition of the
      bits in the TCP header [RFC0793][RFC3168] [RFC3540]:

      As the most significant 4 bits of octets 12 and 13 (counting from
      zero) of the TCP header [RFC0793] are used to encode the TCP data
      offset (header length), the corresponding bits in this Information
      Element MUST be exported as zero and MUST be ignored by the
      collector.  Use the tcpHeaderLength Information Element to encode
      this value.

      Each of the 3 bits (0x800, 0x400, and 0x200), which are reserved
      for future use in [RFC0793], SHOULD be exported as observed in the
      TCP headers of the packets of this Flow.

   NEW:
      As per [RFC9293], the assignment of the TCP control bits is
      managed by IANA from the "TCP Header Flags" registry [TCP-FLAGS].
      That registry is authoritative to retrieve the most recent TCP
      control bits.

      As the most significant 4 bits of octets 12 and 13 (counting from
      zero) of the TCP header [RFC9293] are used to encode the TCP data
      offset (header length), the corresponding bits in this Information

      Element MUST be exported as zero and MUST be ignored by the
      collector.  Use the tcpHeaderLength Information Element to encode
      this value.

      TCP control bits (including unassigned) MUST be exported as
      observed in the TCP headers of the packets of this Flow.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the "tcpControlBits" entry of the [IPFIX]
   as follows:

   *  Update the description of to reflect the change in Section 3.

   *  Add [TCP-FLAGS] to the Additional Information field.

   *  Add this document to the references


5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not add new security considerations to those
   already discussed in Section 5 of [RFC7125].
